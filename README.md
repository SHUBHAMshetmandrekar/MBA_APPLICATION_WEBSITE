# MBA_APPLICATION_WEBSITE
Our project is a user-friendly web portal for MBA candidates, simplifying the application process. Candidates can register, submit documents, and communicate with administrators seamlessly. With robust security and accessibility features, we aim to redefine the application experience.

Due to college policy, we're unable to upload the website code on GitHub. However, to showcase our work, I've included screenshots of the website hosted locally. Additionally, I've uploaded a sample code file named dashboard.php, representing the dashboard for applicants. While we can't share the entire codebase, these resources offer a glimpse into our project's design and functionality.
